It sounds like you're working on an app that tracks income and expenses with a pie chart for expense visualization. Here's a possible breakdown of features and functionality you could consider for the app:

Key Features:
Add Income:

A form to input income details (amount, source, date).

Option to categorize income (e.g., salary, freelance work, investment).

Add Expense:

A form to input expense details (amount, category, date).

Expense categories could include things like food, entertainment, bills, etc.

Expense Summary:

Display a summary of total income, total expenses, and the balance (income - expenses).

Include a breakdown of expenses by category.

Pie Chart:

A visual representation of expenses by category (using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts in React).

The pie chart dynamically updates as you add or remove expenses.

Data Storage:

Use a backend like MongoDB to store income and expense data.

Ensure data persistence across app restarts.

User Interface:

Dashboard with an overview of income, expenses, and balance.

Interactive pie chart that shows expense breakdown.

Steps to Implement:
Backend (Node.js/Express):

Create models for Income and Expense with fields like amount, category, and date.

Implement routes to handle adding, fetching, and deleting income and expenses.

Frontend (React):

Components to add income/expenses and display them in a list.

Use a charting library (like Chart.js or Recharts) to render a pie chart based on expense data.

Pie Chart Logic:

Use data from your expense category field and calculate the percentage of each category in the total expenses.

Summary Calculation:

Calculate the total income, total expense, and balance on the frontend.
